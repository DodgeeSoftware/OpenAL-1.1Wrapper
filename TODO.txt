Nothing left, finished

[] DOXYGEN TAGS NEEDED AND DOXYGEN DOCUMENTATION NEEDS TO BE GENERATED

TASKS COMPLETED

14/08/2016 - 15/08/2016
Final Unit Tests for Wrapper Completion
[DONE] Sound
[DONE] Stream
[DONE] Music
[DONE] Sound2D
[DONE] Sound3D
[DONE] Stream2D
[DONE] Stream3D
[DONE] Capture Audio / Recording
[DONE] Moving the listener around
[DONE] Implemented mute and volume functons at audiosystem scope
    although they dont work very robustly (not my fault OpenAL is pretty bad on this one)
[DONE] Fully implement AudioSystem functions
    [DONE] Capture System / Recording
        [DONE] Initialise the Devices for the AudioSystem in audiosystem::init
        [DONE] Delete the Devices on AudioSystem::shutdown
[DONE] Implement base functions in the source class
[DONE] Make all the audio classes only generate a source after a play method is called
    this will allow us to have better control over how many sources exist
[DONE] Clean up and document the unit tests [Only one not done yet are the capture related ones]
[DONE] Need to be able to set the frequency of sounds, streams (and possibly music)
[DONE] Handle mute for streams, sounds and tracker music
[DONE] Consider adding a 'Source', object to Utils that classes such as Sound, Sound2d, Sound3D, Music, Stream, Stream2D, Stream3d
    can use as base class. This would make the wrapper much much more maintainable. At present we repeat the same
    source related functions over and over again in each of these objects
[DONE] Positional Sound and Stream functions fully implemented
    [DONE] Sound2D
    [DONE] Sound3D
    [DONE] Stream2D
    [DONE] Stream3D

05/08/2016 - 13/08/2016
[DONE] Fully implement Streaming
[DONE] Fully implement Tracker Music
[DONE] Handle looping streams, sounds and tracker music
    [DONE] Music
    [DONE] Sounds
    [DONE] Streams

4/08/2016
    [DONE] Streams now Support Looping
    [DONE] Sounds Now support looping
    [DONE] Mute and Unmute for Music  now work
    [DONE] Looping flag now works for Music
    [DONE] TODO: Implement and use the OpenALVector2D nad OpenALVector3D classes
